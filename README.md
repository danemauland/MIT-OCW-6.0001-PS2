# MIT-OCW-6.0001-PS2
In this problem set I code two versions of the game Hangman, one with hints and one without.

This project contains my work done for MIT Opencourseware's class 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, Problem Set 2. Included in addition to my code are the instructions for the problem set and a word.txt file that the game uses. MIT provides this material under a Creative Commons License.
